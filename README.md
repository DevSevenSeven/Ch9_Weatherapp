This is the backend code for weather app using open weather api. I was provided a starer code (Frontend). I have to build the back end code for the Wether Dashboard, connect it to the already created frontend code, and then deploy the entire application to Render. I have to use the 5-day weather forecast APILinks to an external site and retrieve weather data for cities: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5/

#User Story | 
AS A traveler I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

#Acceptance Criteria | 
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs WHEN I search for a city THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city, and that city is added to the search history WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, a description of the weather for the icon's alt tag, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity WHEN I click on a city in the search history THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

#Current Process | 
I have attempted this challenge to the best of my ability at this time and moment and I believe my misundertanding is in how to call the methods for the objects. I have to gain more practice in building functions and get more practice inside the node.js enviroment. I examined as much examples as I could from past lessons and did some research on my own trying to understand these different processes but I ran out of time. I will continue to work on this project regadless of the grade or incomplete that I get.

#What I Have Learned | 
I learned the node.js enviroment provides a framework for javascript to be used on the server side and there are many resources for server side like api, routes and more.
